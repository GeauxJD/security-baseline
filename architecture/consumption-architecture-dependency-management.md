# Introduction
## Context and Scope
This document captures technologies that are hosted in OpenSSF and some technologies in CNCF. The technical stack in this document demonstrates how OSS security technologies make software supply chain more secure through dependency management. 

The goals of this document are:
1. To help open source producers quickly navigate the OSS security technology landscape, discover, adopt and contribute to technical initiatives. 
2. To provide an easy model for our end user organizations large and small to have a framework/reference architecture to help them think about adopting OpenSSF technical projects and guidance. 

This document is based on the previous work conducted in OpenSSF [BEST Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers):

# Open Source Software Dependency Management 
Open source software is the foundation of the digital world we live in. It powers critical infrastructure and impacts people's everyday lives. 

[SonaType latest state of the software supply chain report](https://www.sonatype.com/state-of-the-software-supply-chain/Introduction) has show among the monitored OSS ecosystems:
* An average 29% of year-over-year growth of OSS projects
* Demands for open source ecosystems are still growing, measured by the number of download requests
* The number of malicious packages tripled in 2023 compared to 2022. 
* In September 2023, 245,032 malicious packages were discovered, 2x all previous years (2019-2022) combined. 
  
[Synopsys latest open source security and risk analysis report](https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity/resources/analyst-reports/open-source-security-risk-analysis.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=open_source_security_tool&utm_campaign=G_S_OSSRA_BMM&cmp=ps-SIG-G_S_OSSRA_BMM&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwko21BhAPEiwAwfaQCKkvVOJOS1uu4S7zF1p9uqhcdwrCNXNbMl7EcD5L0SIgS58-jUj_OxoC7FwQAvD_BwE#introMenu) has shown that among the surveyed comemrcial software:
* 96% of the total codebase contained open source.
* 77% of all code in the total code base originated from open source.
* 84% of the codebases contained at least one open source vulnerability.
* 54% increase in codedebases containing high-risk vulnerabilities in the past year.

Open source software dependency management is critical to sustain software security and reliability. 

## Open Source Software Supply Chain Threats
![OSS Supply Chain Threats](https://github.com/Danajoyluck/security-baseline/blob/Danajoyluck-patch-1/architecture/images/OpenSSF_OSS_Supply_Chain_Threats.jpg)

Security threats exist in every link of the OSS supply chain, from upstream maintainers to consumers. OSS producers are also OSS consumers. For details of the threats, check out the threat modeling that OpenSSF [BEST Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers) and [End User Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-endusers) have conducted:
* [Threats against OSS producers](https://github.com/ossf/toolbelt/blob/main/threats/Developer_Threats.md)
* [Threats against OSS producers' development environments](https://github.com/ossf/toolbelt/blob/main/threats/Developer_Environment_Threats.md)
* [Threats against OSS Source Code Management(SCM) systems](https://github.com/ossf/toolbelt/blob/main/threats/Source_Code_Management_Threats.md)
* [Threats against OSS CI/CD systems](https://github.com/ossf/toolbelt/blob/main/threats/Build%2BCI_Threats.md)
* [Threats against OSS publication/distribution](https://github.com/ossf/toolbelt/blob/main/threats/Publication_Threats.md)
* [Threat Model of Enterprise Open Source Supply Chains](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kNCETEfm2_Pm9dFwmDJfph0TtUCK1-3ERL4OjA9UKYI/edit)

Every OSS threat category requires OSS dependency management to reduce the risks from the OSS supply chain threats. The diagram below demonstrates the significance of choosing safe dependencies by OSS producers when start developing their software, securing the development environment, securing the SCM systems to reduce the risks of unauthorized code which leads to malicious dependencies, ingesting safe dependencies into the CI process from package registries, and securing the package registries to prevent malicious packages from being uploaded and legit packages from being compromised. OSS consumers need to manage dependencies to ensure safe OSS consumption to sustain their software/product/service security and reliability.

### Overview
![overview](https://github.com/Danajoyluck/security-baseline/blob/Danajoyluck-patch-1/architecture/images/OpenSSF_Practitioner_Framework%20_Overview.jpg)

OpenSSF and its peer foundations provide OSS technologies to raise security awareness through education and training, establish best software development practices, guides, security standards, frameworks, specifications, and provide security tools to improve open source software dependency management. The security tools are built on top of the ecosystem support to make open source software ecosystems more secure.

Every layer in the diagram provides support to the layers above it, relies on the underneath layers for foundational support. 

### Dependency Ingestion Policy and Enforcement

![State](https://github.com/Danajoyluck/security-baseline/blob/Danajoyluck-patch-1/architecture/images/OpenSSF_Practitioner_Framework_state.jpg)
![policy and enforcement](https://github.com/Danajoyluck/security-baseline/blob/Danajoyluck-patch-1/architecture/images/OpenSSF_Practitioner_Framework%20_Ingestion_Policy_and_Enforcement.jpg)

To sustain OSS dependency management at scale, with accuracy and efficiency, we need technical solutions that can define software ingestion policies and enforce those policies. For example, if an open source software has not been maintained actively, the software should not be introduced into your code base. 

The diagram has illustrated that dependency ingestion policy and enforcement is a very green field on OSS producer side (This may change soon with Minder joining OpenSSF as an OSS project). The technologies in this layer will evolve as we gain more [Security Insights into OSS Projects](#security-insights-into-oss-projects). On the customer side, organizations have their own governance and technologies in managing OSS dependencies. 
* [giituf](https://github.com/gittuf/gittuf) is an OpenSSF [sandbox](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/project-lifecycle.md#stages---definitions--expectations) project hosted in the [Supply Chain Integrity Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-supply-chain-integrity). It provides a security layer over Git. It's in active development phase and conducts policy validation. 
* [Witness](https://github.com/in-toto/witness) is a CNCF project under the [in-toto](https://github.com/in-toto) umbrella that protects software supply chain integrity. Witness comes with an OPA policy engine that verifies the software attestation and ensures that your dependency was handled safely from source to deployment. Witness in-toto attestation feature is available for CI systems on OSS producer side and consumer side  
* [Repository Service for TUF(RSTUF](https://github.com/repository-service-tuf/repository-service-tuf) is an OpenSSF [incubating](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/project-lifecycle.md#stages---definitions--expectations) project in the [Securing Software Repositories Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-securing-software-repos). The verification component of RSTUF provides metadata verification to ensure the software that's being ingested is as expected. RSTUF metadata verification can be used by both CI systems on OSS producer side and consumer side.    

The target state of achieving end to end OSS supply chain security is to have policy enforcement at every link of the supply chain. As software flows from OSS producers' development environment into the SCM system, a Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) should only allow the software into the SCM system when the software meets pre-defined policies, CI system should fail the integration that's triggered by an SCM event if PEP policy validation fails, package registry should block a package being published or prevent a package from being distributed when PEP identified policy violation. Similar policy enforcement should be adopted on the consumer side as well. in-toto attestation provides the metadata for PEP. 


### Security Insights into OSS Projects

![State](https://github.com/Danajoyluck/security-baseline/blob/Danajoyluck-patch-1/architecture/images/OpenSSF_Practitioner_Framework_state.jpg)
![Security Insights](https://github.com/Danajoyluck/security-baseline/blob/Danajoyluck-patch-1/architecture/images/OpenSSF_Practitioner_Framework_Security_Insights.jpg)

Gaining insights into OSS Projects is the collective effort of multiple technologies across multiple layers:
* Security Metadata Data Aggregation and Synthesis ( Health Metrics, SBOM, VEX, OSV,  in-toto Attestation, SLSA Provenance, TUF Metadata )
  * [GUAC](https://github.com/guacsec/guac) is an OpenSSF [sandbox](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/project-lifecycle.md#stages---definitions--expectations) project hosted in the [Supply Chain Integrity Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-supply-chain-integrity). GUAC provides both API and UI functionalities.
  * [Protobom](http://github.com/bom-squad/protobom) is an OpenSSF [sandbox](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/project-lifecycle.md#stages---definitions--expectations) project hosted in the [Security Tooling Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-security-tooling). It's a library, a specification and a set of tools for SBOMs. It's the universal I/O layer for translating SBOMs in SPDX and CycloneDX formats. 
  * GUAC aggregates health metrics information via Scorecard API, Scorecard Structured Results API in the future, deps.dev API and OSV API. It also aggregates SBOM from projects from a centralized storage where OSS projects publish SBOM, VEX, OSV, in-toto Attestation, SLSA Provenance, TUF Metadata, or pull these information from OSS projects. It's intended to be used by both OSS producers and consumers to make informed decisions on choosing an OSS dependency.  
* Dependency Graph, Licenses, Vulnerabilities, Privileged Access
  * [deps.dev](https://deps.dev/) is a free service hosted by Google. The service provides details of an OSS software dependencies, dependents, vulnerabilities and license information. It also provides Google assured open source software. [OSV](https://osv.dev/) is an open source database for open source. It provides vulnerability information to deps.dev. OSV ingests vulnerability data from 20+ security advisories and provide vulnerability information at the package level, more granular than NVD. [OSV schema](https://github.com/ossf/osv-schema) specification provides data model for OSV database, and is hosted in OpenSSF [Vulnerability Disclosures Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures). 
* OSS Security Health Assessment
  * [Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) is a widely adopted OpenSSF project in OSS ecosystems. It assesses an open source project's security health posture, reports findings at various risk levels and provides recommendations on improving the project's security posture. For an OpenSSF project to enter into incubating stage, the project MUST adopt Scorecard per OpenSSF [TAC requirements](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/TI-Gives%2BGets.md#givesrequirements-1). Scorecard has [launched V5](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/releases/tag/v5.0.0) focusing on structured results which will accelerate the development of security policy enforcement.  
* OSS Security Policy Enforcement
  * [Allstar](https://github.com/ossf/allstar) is a sibling project of Scorecard, hosted in [Securing Critical Projects Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-securing-critical-projects). It's in the process of consolidating into the same working group as Scorecard. It's capable of enforcing rules base on Scorecard checks at GitHub organization level. It features raising alerts once it detects risky behaviors or malpractices and creates a pull request to signal maintainers to take action.
  * [Trusted Publisher](https://repos.openssf.org/trusted-publishers-for-all-package-repositories) is an initiative in OpenSSF [Securing Software Repositories Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-securing-software-repos). It allows a package repository like the Python Package Index (PyPI) to authenticate an identity using a short lived OIDC token. It works in conjunction with a trusted publishing policy on the package repository/registry side. Trusted Publishers ensures a package is coming from a trusted CI system, workflow, hosted machine or build pipeline.  

###  Generating Verifiable Cryptographically Signed Artifacts Attestation, Metadata

![State](https://github.com/Danajoyluck/security-baseline/blob/Danajoyluck-patch-1/architecture/images/OpenSSF_Practitioner_Framework_state.jpg)
![Security Metadata](https://github.com/Danajoyluck/security-baseline/blob/Danajoyluck-patch-1/architecture/images/OpenSSF_Practitioner_Framework%20_Attestation.jpg)

Signed artifacts are only useful when it's verifiable, as our maintainers always say.
* OSS Metadata Generation, Storage and Verification ( SBOM, VEX, Attestation, Provenance, TUF Metadata)
  * As OSS software goes through the supply chain to be built, released/deployed, and distributed. To provide integrity guarantees, OSS maintainers apply digital signing techniques to have these software signed, and provide attestation about where the source code is, who write the software, why it's being built, what systems builds it, when it's built and how it's built.
  * The digital signatures ensure the integrity, authenticity, and trustworthiness of release artifacts. The attestations provide verifiable and non-forgeable claims about the artifacts' origin and build process.
  * [Witness](https://github.com/in-toto/witness) provides in-toto attestation creation and verification. It's companion project [archivista](https://github.com/in-toto/archivista) provides storage for in-toto attestations. 
  * [SLSA](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa) is an OpenSSF project in the [Supply Chain Integrity Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-supply-chain-integrity). SLSA is a specification and a set of tools for OSS producers to adopt and increase levels of software security and supply chain integrity. SLSA provenance provides verifiable evidence to trace software to its origin.  
  * [Security Insight](https://github.com/ossf/security-insights-spec) is an OpenSSF specification project in the [Supply Chain Integrity Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-supply-chain-integrity). It defines the schema for the so called SECURITY_INSIGHTS.yml metadata file. The meatata data provides insights into your project’s security in both human and machine processable format([example](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/blob/main/SECURITY-INSIGHTS.yml)).
  * [bomctl](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bomctl/bomctl@v0.2.1#section-readme) is an experimental project being actively developed. It integrates with GUAC and Sigstore. The tool works hand in hand with Protobom.
  * [vexctl](https://github.com/openvex/vexctl) is a flagship project under [OpenVEX](https://github.com/openvex). vexctl generates, merges and attest VEX statements.
  * [OpenVEX](https://github.com/openvex) is a [sandbox](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/project-lifecycle-documents/openvex_for_sandbox_stage.md) project in the [Vulnerability Disclosures Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures). It is a specification, a Go library and a set of tools for VEX. 
* Digital Signing , Signature Verification, Transparency Log
  * [Sigstore](https://github.com/sigstore) is an an OpenSSF [graduated](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/project-lifecycle-documents/sigstore_graduated_stage.md) project under [OpenSSF TAC](https://github.com/ossf/tac) directly. Sigstore public instance provides digital signing capability, OIDC PKI infrastructure, and a transparency  log infrastructure for OSS projects. Sigstore is the trust foundation for OSS digital signing using a short lived X.509 certificate. Sigstore transparency log provides an immutable, tamper-resistant ledger of artifact attestations. gitsign is a tool within Sigstore ecosystem that provides Git signing with OSS producers' own GitHub / OIDC identity.   

### Ecosystem Support

![Ecosystem Support](https://github.com/Danajoyluck/security-baseline/blob/Danajoyluck-patch-1/architecture/images/OpenSSF_Practitioner_Framework_Ecosystem_Support.jpg)

The digram illustrates the supports that OSS projects expect to get from the ecosystems that host the projects, and the typical patterns that OSS consumers in an organization adopt to manage software securities including dependency manageent. 

### Frameworks, Specifications, Standards, Education and Training

![State](https://github.com/Danajoyluck/security-baseline/blob/Danajoyluck-patch-1/architecture/images/OpenSSF_Practitioner_Framework_state.jpg)
![Frameworks, Specifications, Standards, Education and Training](https://github.com/Danajoyluck/security-baseline/blob/Danajoyluck-patch-1/architecture/images/OpenSSF_Practitioner_Framework_Framework_Specifications_Standards_Education.jpg)

OpenSSF and peer foundations hosts software security frameworks, specifications, standards that propels the development of security tooling. This section focuses on the technologies that we have not got a chance to touch on in the previous sections:
* [S2C2F](https://github.com/ossf/s2c2f) is an an OpenSSF [incubating](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/project-lifecycle-documents/s2c2f_incubation_stage.md) project in the [Supply Chain Integrity Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-supply-chain-integrity). It's for OSS consumers' organizations. The framework defines how to securely consume OSS dependencies by the developers.
* [SBOMit](https://github.com/sbomit) is a [sandbox](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/project-lifecycle-documents/SBOMit_sandbox_stage.md) project in OpenSSF [Security Tooling Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-security-tooling). It standardizes the naming and location of SBOMs.
* [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/) is an open standard hosts in Linux Foundation. It's capable of representing systems with software components in as SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials) and other AI, data and security references supporting a range of risk management use cases. The SPDX specification is a freely available international open standard (ISO/IEC 5692:2021). It's also a set of tools for generating SBOMs.
* [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) is backed by [OWASP Foundation].(https://owasp.org/) It's a full-stack Bill of Materials (BOM) standard that provides advanced supply chain capabilities for cyber risk reduction. It supports SBOM, Machine Learning Bill of Materials (ML-BOM), Cryptography Bill of Materials (CBOM), Vulnerability Disclosure Reports (VDR), Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) and CycloneDX Attestations (CDXA).
* [in-toto](https://github.com/in-toto) is a CNCF project. It's a framework for protecting software supply chain integrity. It relies on in-toto attestation to verify that each task in the chain is carried out as planned, by authorized personnel only, and that the product is not tampered. The in-toto attestation framework provides a specification for generating attestation about how a piece of software is produced. Consumers or users of software can use the attestation to validate the origins of the software, and establish trust in its supply chain.
* [TUF](https://github.com/theupdateframework) is a framework for securing software update systems. OpenSSF RSTUF is an implementation of TUF and abstracts the implementation details from RSTUF consumers into API calls.
* [Security baseline](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/security_baseline.md) is an OpenSSF security standard. It's part of the OpenSSF [TAC project lifecycle](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/project-lifecycle.md). The security baseline is intended to uplift the OSS projects security posture consistently at large scale.  [Security Baseline Special Interest Group](https://github.com/ossf/security-baseline) supports the adoption of the security baseline and maintain the standard in collaboration with TAC. The special interest group is a venue for collaboration among foundations to build Linux Foundation security baseline.  
* [Best Practice Badge](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge) is a widely-used project in Linux Foundation. Many foundations use the badge levels as their project graduation criteria, including OpenSSF. The program is in the [BEST Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers).
* Education
  * OpenSSF working groups have produced comprehensive guides for making open source software more secure. The guides are for both OSS producers and consumers. The foundation also provides free [online courses](https://openssf.org/training/) for developer, including [Sigstore training](https://openssf.org/training/securing-your-software-supply-chain-with-sigstore-course/) and [Scorecard training](https://openssf.org/training/securing-projects-with-openssf-scorecard-course/).
